**Project Name**: Computer Lab Issue Tracking System

**Description**:
The Computer Lab Issue Tracking System is a web-based application designed to streamline the reporting and resolution of computer-related issues within a computer lab environment. It allows students to report problems they encounter with lab computers and enables lab administrators to manage and resolve these issues efficiently.

**Key Features**:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Students can log in securely to access the issue reporting system.
   - Lab administrators have access to the admin panel.

2. **Issue Reporting**:
   - Students can submit tickets describing computer-related issues they encounter in the lab.
   - Each ticket includes details such as the issue description, computer ID, and date of submission.

3. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Lab administrators can view and manage submitted tickets.
   - Tickets are categorized as open issues awaiting resolution.

4. **Ticket Management**:
   - Lab administrators can mark tickets as resolved when the issue is fixed.
   - Tickets can be categorized into hardware or software issues for better organization.

**Technology Stack**:

- **Backend**: Python with Django framework
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (Django's default database)

- **Version Control**: Git (hosted on GitHub)

**GitHub Repository**: Provide the link to your public GitHub repository for easy access and collaboration.

**Purpose**:
The Computer Lab Issue Tracking System simplifies the process of reporting and resolving computer-related problems within a lab environment. It enhances communication between students and lab administrators, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly and efficiently. Lab administrators can track, categorize, and resolve issues, leading to improved lab usability and user satisfaction.

Since your project uses SQLite as the database and is deployed on PythonAnywhere, make sure to include information in your documentation about the database setup (if any specific setup is required for SQLite) and the deployment process on PythonAnywhere. This will help users and potential contributors understand how to run and use your project effectively in its specific environment.
